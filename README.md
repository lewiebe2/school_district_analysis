# **School District Analysis**

## **Overview**

My client Maria requested a new analysis of the school district's state-testing math and reading scores after evidence of academic dishonesty was found. At her direction, I have rerun the analysis without the Thomas High School 9th grade math and reading scores.

## **Results**

#### *District Summary*

The district summary was mostly unaffected, with only a few tenths difference between the average scores and percent passing.

#### *School Summary*

The only difference in the school summary is that Thomas High School's Average Reading Score increased one tenth.

#### *Thomas High School Performance*

Removing the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School did not change that school's performance relative to the other schools. Thomas High School is still in the top five performing schools:

The bottom five schools are also unchanged:
